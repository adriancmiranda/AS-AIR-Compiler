Another flash compiler

![grunt!](https://raw2.github.com/adriancmiranda/flash-compiler/master/examples/desktop/html/source/application/images/bullet-grunt.gif)
[Grunt](http://gruntjs.com/) is used to build, preview and test your project, thanks to help from tasks curated by the Yeoman team and grunt-contrib.

![bower!](https://raw2.github.com/adriancmiranda/flash-compiler/master/examples/desktop/html/source/application/images/bullet-bower.gif)
[Bower](http://bower.io/) is used for dependency management, so that you no longer have to manually download and manage your scripts.

Usage
=====

    sh build

or

    chmod +x build && ./build

or

    double-click on it
